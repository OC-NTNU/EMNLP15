@article{Raja2013PPInterFindera,
	Abstract = {One of the most common and challenging problem in biomedical text mining is to mine protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from MEDLINE abstracts and full-text research articles because PPIs play a major role in understanding the various biological processes and the impact of proteins in diseases. We implemented, PPInterFinder--a web-based text mining tool to extract human PPIs from biomedical literature. PPInterFinder uses relation keyword co-occurrences with protein names to extract information on PPIs from MEDLINE abstracts and consists of three phases. First, it identifies the relation keyword using a parser with Tregex and a relation keyword dictionary. Next, it automatically identifies the candidate PPI pairs with a set of rules related to PPI recognition. Finally, it extracts the relations by matching the sentence with a set of 11 specific patterns based on the syntactic nature of PPI pair. We find that PPInterFinder is capable of predicting PPIs with the accuracy of 66.05% on AIMED corpus and outperforms most of the existing systems.

Excitation is a semantic property of predicates that classifies them into excitatory, inhibitory and neutral. We show that Excitation is useful for extracting contradiction pairs (e.g., destroy cancer \&bottom; develop cancer) and causality pairs (e.g., increase in crime â‡’ heighten anxiety). Our experiments show that with automatically acquired Excitation knowledge we can extract one million contradiction pairs and 500,000 causality pairs with about 70\% precision from a 600 million page Web corpus. Furthermore, by combining these extracted causality and contradiction pairs, we can generate one million plausible causality hypotheses that are not written in any single sentence in our corpus with reasonable precision.},

This requires solving a host of classical data management challenges including data acquisition (e.g., from scanned documents), data extraction, and data integration. {SIGMOD} attendees will see demonstrations of three aspects of our system: (1) an end-to-end system that is of a high enough quality to perform novel geological science, but is written by a small enough team so that each aspect can be manageably explained; (2) a simple feature engineering system that allows a user to write in familiar {SQL} or Python; and (3) the effect of different sources of feedback on result quality including expert labeling, distant supervision, traditional rules, and crowd-sourced data. Our prototype builds on our work integrating statistical inference and learning tools into traditional database systems. If successful, our demonstration will allow attendees to see that data processing systems that use machine learning contain many familiar data processing problems such as efficient querying, indexing, and supporting tools for database-backed websites, none of which are machine-learning problems, per se.},

This work includes building three extensive ontologies to describe molecular function, biological process, and cellular component, and providing a community database resource that supports the use of these ontologies. The {GO} Consortium was initiated by scientists associated with three model organism databases: {SGD}, the Saccharomyces Genome database; {FlyBase}, the Drosophila genome database; and {MGD}/{GXD}, the Mouse Genome Informatics databases.

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lately, there has been a great interest in the application of information extraction methods to the biomedical domain, in particular, to the extraction of relationships of genes, proteins, and {RNA} from scientific publications. The development and evaluation of such methods requires annotated domain corpora. {RESULTS}: We present {BioInfer} (Bio Information Extraction Resource), a new public resource providing an annotated corpus of biomedical English. We describe an annotation scheme capturing named entities and their relationships along with a dependency analysis of sentence syntax. We further present ontologies defining the types of entities and relationships annotated in the corpus. Currently, the corpus contains 1100 sentences from abstracts of biomedical research articles annotated for relationships, named entities, as well as syntactic dependencies. Supporting software is provided with the corpus. The corpus is unique in the domain in combining these annotation types for a single set of sentences, and in the level of detail of the relationship annotation. {CONCLUSION}: We introduce a corpus targeted at protein, gene, and {RNA} relationships which serves as a resource for the development of information extraction systems and their components such as parsers and domain analyzers. The corpus will be maintained and further developed with a current version being available at {http://www.it.utu.fi/BioInfer}.},

@article{Hirschman2005Overview,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:The goal of the first {BioCreAtIvE} challenge (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction in Biology) was to provide a set of common evaluation tasks to assess the state of the art for text mining applied to biological problems. The results were presented in a workshop held in Granada, Spain March 28-31, 2004. The articles collected in this {BMC} Bioinformatics supplement entitled "A critical assessment of text mining methods in molecular biology" describe the {BioCreAtIvE} tasks, systems, results and their independent {evaluation.RESULTS}:{BioCreAtIvE} focused on two tasks. The first dealt with extraction of gene or protein names from text, and their mapping into standardized gene identifiers for three model organism databases (fly, mouse, yeast). The second task addressed issues of functional annotation, requiring systems to identify specific text passages that supported Gene Ontology annotations for specific proteins, given full text {articles.CONCLUSION}:The first {BioCreAtIvE} assessment achieved a high level of international participation (27 groups from 10 countries). The assessment provided state-of-the-art performance results for a basic task (gene name finding and normalization), where the best systems achieved a balanced 80\% precision / recall or better, which potentially makes them suitable for real applications in biology. The results for the advanced task (functional annotation from free text) were significantly lower, demonstrating the current limitations of text-mining approaches where knowledge extrapolation and interpretation are required. In addition, an important contribution of {BioCreAtIvE} has been the creation and release of training and test data sets for both tasks. There are 22 articles in this special issue, including six that provide analyses of results or data quality for the data sets, including a novel inter-annotator consistency assessment for the test set used in task 2.},

@article{Pyysalo2012Overview,
	Abstract = {We present the preparation, resources, results and analysis of three tasks of the {BioNLP} Shared Task 2011: the main tasks on Infectious Diseases ({ID}) and Epigenetics and Post-translational Modifications ({EPI}), and the supporting task on Entity Relations ({REL}). The two main tasks represent extensions of the event extraction model introduced in the {BioNLP} Shared Task 2009 ({ST}'09) to two new areas of biomedical scientific literature, each motivated by the needs of specific biocuration tasks. The {ID} task concerns the molecular mechanisms of infection, virulence and resistance, focusing in particular on the functions of a class of signaling systems that are ubiquitous in bacteria. The {EPI} task is dedicated to the extraction of statements regarding chemical modifications of {DNA} and proteins, with particular emphasis on changes relating to the epigenetic control of gene expression. By contrast to these two application-oriented main tasks, the {REL} task seeks to support extraction in general by separating challenges relating to part-of relations into a subproblem that can be addressed by independent systems. Seven groups participated in each of the two main tasks and four groups in the supporting task. The participating systems indicated advances in the capability of event extraction methods and demonstrated generalization in many aspects: from abstracts to full texts, from previously considered subdomains to new ones, and from the {ST}'09 extraction targets to other entities and events. The highest performance achieved in the supporting task {REL}, 58\% F-score, is broadly comparable with levels reported for other relation extraction tasks. For the {ID} task, the highest-performing system achieved 56\% F-score, comparable to the state-of-the-art performance at the established {ST}'09 task. In the {EPI} task, the best result was 53\% F-score for the full set of extraction targets and 69\% F-score for a reduced set of core extraction targets, approaching a level of performance sufficient for user-facing applications. In this study, we extend on previously reported results and perform further analyses of the outputs of the participating systems. We place specific emphasis on aspects of system performance relating to real-world applicability, considering alternate evaluation metrics and performing additional manual analysis of system outputs. We further demonstrate that the strengths of extraction systems can be combined to improve on the performance achieved by any system in isolation. The manually annotated corpora, supporting resources, and evaluation tools for all tasks are available from http://www.bionlp-st.org and the tasks continue as open challenges for all interested parties.},

	Abstract = {{The volume of published biomedical research, and therefore the underlying biomedical knowledge base, is expanding at an increasing rate. Among the tools that can aid researchers in coping with this information overload are text mining and knowledge extraction. Significant progress has been made in applying text mining to named entity recognition, text classification, terminology extraction, relationship extraction and hypothesis generation. Several research groups are constructing integrated flexible text-mining systems intended for multiple uses. The major challenge of biomedical text mining over the next 5--10 years is to make these systems useful to biomedical researchers. This will require enhanced access to full text, better understanding of the feature space of biomedical literature, better methods for measuring the usefulness of systems to users, and continued cooperation with the biomedical research community to ensure that their needs are addressed.}},

	Abstract = {{The complexity and wide range of current biomedical research is reflected in the number and scope of biomedical publications. Due to this abundance scientists are often no longer capable of keeping up with publications in their specific areas of research, let alone finding, reading, and analyzing potentially related scientific publications. Real advances in research, however, can be achieved only if a researcher can obtain an overview of the state of a given research question in a timely manner. This chapter presents methods to help researchers access the content of the biomedical literature. Information Retrieval (IR) identifies, in a large document database, the documents that are most relevant to a search topic provided by a user. Natural Language Processing (NLP) affords finer-grained access to more precise information contained in texts, which opens up a range of data analysis and knowledge synthesis functionalities. Powerful tools have been designed to exploit these techniques for the benefit of biomedical researchers, extracting millions of facts from the published literature and assisting Literature-Based Discovery. This chapter is organized as follows. It first describes the current capacities of IR from the Medline{\textregistered} bibliographic database. A short introduction to the main concepts of Natural Language Processing follows. Tasks which build on Natural Language Processing are then presented: Information Extraction and its derivatives and Literature-Based Discovery. A review of some existing applications closes the chapter. The references cited in the text are supplemented by a list of textbooks and Web resources.}},

Such interactions and their downstream effects are known as events. To computationally mine the literature for such events, text mining methods that can detect, extract and annotate them are required. This review summarizes the methods that are currently available, with a specific focus on protein-protein interactions and pathway or network reconstruction. The approaches described will be of considerable value in associating particular pathways and their components with higher-order physiological properties, including disease states.

	Abstract = {{Efficient access to information contained in online scientific literature collections is essential for life science research, playing a crucial role from the initial stage of experiment planning to the final interpretation and communication of the results. The biological literature also constitutes the main information source for manual literature curation used by expert-curated databases. Following the increasing popularity of web-based applications for analyzing biological data, new text-mining and information extraction strategies are being implemented. These systems exploit existing regularities in natural language to extract biologically relevant information from electronic texts automatically. The aim of the BioCreative challenge is to promote the development of such tools and to provide insight into their performance. This review presents a general introduction to the main characteristics and applications of currently available text-mining systems for life sciences in terms of the following: the type of biological information demands being addressed; the level of information granularity of both user queries and results; and the features and methods commonly exploited by these applications. The current trend in biomedical text mining points toward an increasing diversification in terms of application types and techniques, together with integration of domain-specific resources such as ontologies. Additional descriptions of some of the systems discussed here are available on the internet http://zope.bioinfo.cnio.es/bionlp\_tools/.}},

	Abstract = {{With biomedical literature increasing at a rate of several thousand papers per week, it is impossible to keep abreast of all developments; therefore, automated means to manage the information overload are required. Text mining techniques, which involve the processes of information retrieval, information extraction and data mining, provide a means of solving this. By adding meaning to text, these techniques produce a more structured analysis of textual knowledge than simple word searches, and can provide powerful tools for the production and analysis of systems biology models.}},

@article{Swanson1997Interactive,
	Abstract = {An unintended consequence of specialization in science is poor communication across specialties. Information developed in one area of research may be of value in another without anyone becoming aware of the fact. We describe and evaluate interactive software and database search strategies that facilitate the discovery of previously unknown cross specialty information of scientific interest. The user begins by searching {MEDLINE} for article titles that identify a problem or topic of interest. From downloaded titles the software constructs input for additional database searches and produces a series of heuristic aids that help the user select a second set of articles complementary to the first set and from a different area of research. The two sets are complementary if together they can reveal new useful information that cannot be inferred from either set alone. The software output further helps the user identify the new information and derive from it a novel testable hypothesis. We report several successful tests and applications of the system.},
